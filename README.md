# Data + AI CLI Tool

A simple and secure Python project that connects to the [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/) and analyzes structured data from a JSON file. The application supports `.env` for secure API key storage and allows for both automatic data summarization and interactive questioning.

## Application Features

- Terminal-based interface for communicating with AI (e.g., ChatGPT)
- Secure storage of API key using `.env` file
- Integration with OpenAI Chat Completions API
- Automatic summary of data from a JSON file
- Interactive question mode about the loaded data
- Requirements listed in `requirements.txt` for easy setup
- Lightweight foundation for more advanced data+AI projects

## Technologies

- Python 3.x
- OpenAI API
- Libraries: `openai`, `python-dotenv`

## Installation and Configuration

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/andrzejga1/data-ai-cli-tool.git
   cd data-ai-cli-tool
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Register at OpenAI:
   - Go to: https://platform.openai.com/docs/overview
   - Create an account
   - In the Billing section, add credit (e.g., $5)
   - Disable "Enable auto recharge" if you don't want automatic top-ups

4. Set up your API key:
   - Go to: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
   - Generate and copy your API key
   - Copy the `.env_example` file and rename it to `.env`
   - Add your key to the `.env` file:
     ```
     OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
     ```
   - Ensure `.env` is added to `.gitignore` to avoid exposing it in your repo

5. Run the application in the terminal:
   ```
   python app.py path/to/yourfile.json
   ```

6. Ask questions:
   - The program will automatically summarize the data
   - Then it will prompt: "Would you like to ask a question about the data? (y/n)"
   - Type your question and receive a contextual AI response
